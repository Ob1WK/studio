    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support HolyHarmonies' core features—song uploads, variation submissions, playlists, and sharing—while adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Structural Segregation, and Access Modeling. User-owned data is organized under `/users/{userId}` for clear ownership. Songs are also organized under the respective user. Variations are kept within the songs to maintain referential integrity. Playlists are user-specific to manage their personal lists efficiently. To support sharing, each song contains a `sharedLink` field, facilitating quick distribution.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** User-specific data like songs, variations, and playlists are nested under `/users/{userId}`, eliminating the need for complex authorization rules involving parent document lookups. The `userId` within songs, variations, and playlists are used in rules to independently verify ownership.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** Each collection serves a distinct purpose with homogenous security requirements. `/users/{userId}` contains only user-specific data accessible by the user.\n\n**QAPs Support:** The structure supports listing songs and playlists securely because each is associated with a specific user, enabling rules to filter based on `request.auth.uid` without relying on data lookups. Public/private playlist distinction is achieved with the `isPublic` field, allowing secure listing of public playlists."
