/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for HolyHarmonies.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for writes, but allows public read access
 * for community features like exploring songs and user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Readable by all, writable by owner.
 * - /songs/{songId}: Stores all songs. Readable by all, writable by owner.
 * - /songs/{songId}/variations/{variationId}: Stores variations. Readable by all, writable by owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/playlists/{playlistId}: Stores private references to user-created playlists.
 * - /playlists/{playlistId}: Stores public playlists for sharing and real-time sessions.
