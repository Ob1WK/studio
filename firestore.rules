/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for HolyHarmonies.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has full control over their own data.
 * All private data is nested under /users/{userId} to clearly define ownership and simplify authorization.
 * Public data, like shared playlists, is stored in top-level collections for easy access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information and private data.
 * - /users/{userId}/songs/{songId}: Stores songs uploaded by a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/playlists/{playlistId}: Stores user-created playlists.
 * - /playlists/{playlistId}: Stores public playlists for sharing and real-time sessions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only write to their own data.
 * - Any user can read from the public /playlists/{playlistId} collection if the playlist's isPublic flag is true.
 * - The admin of a playlist (the owner) can update the real-time session fields (currentSongId, transpose).
