/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for HolyHarmonies.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has full control over their own data.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId} to clearly define ownership and simplify authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user with the matching userId can access it.
 * - /users/{userId}/songs/{songId}: Stores songs uploaded by a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/songs/{songId}/variations/{variationId}: Stores variations of a song submitted by users.
 * - /users/{userId}/playlists/{playlistId}: Stores user-created playlists.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing songs, variations and playlists are allowed for the owner only.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field is included in songs, variations, and playlists to independently verify ownership without requiring parent document lookups.
